    "# Introdcution to SymPy\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an introdcution to the SymPy symbolic manipulation library in Python. This library forms the basis of both Octave and Sage, two CAS systems written in Python. SymPy is the free-standing library which is used in symbolic manipulation. The library has the capability to solve expressions which arise in algebra, calculus, statistics, etc. Ocatave and Sage are programs using SymPy's methods to perfom mathematical calaculations. This notebook, accompanying the Topcode THRIVE post on SymPy, will highlight some functions and introduce the community to a useful Python library."
